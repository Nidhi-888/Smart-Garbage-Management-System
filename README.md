Level of garbage in dustbins is detected with help of Sensor systems &amp; communicated to the authorized control room through GSM system. Microcontroller is 
used to interface the sensor system with GSM system. Application will be solution.
#Problem - With increase in population, the scenario of cleanliness with respect to garbage management is degrading tremendously. It may provoke several serious 
diseases amongst the nearby people. It also degrades the valuation of the area. To avoid this and to enhance the cleaning, ‘smart garbage management system’ is 
proposed im. In the proposed system, the level of garbage in the dustbins is detected with the help of Sensor systems, and communicated to the authorized control room through GSM system. Microcontroller is used to interface the sensor system and GSM technology.This will help to manage the garbage collection efficiently.This application will be a all in one solution for garbage management as driver and garbage collector will be connected through each other via application portal.
